# Multi-Domain Forensic Detection of AI-Tampered Images and Deepfake Videos

## Description
This project presents a **multi-domain forensic detection framework** designed to identify **AI-tampered images and deepfake videos**.  
The framework integrates **spatial image forensics** and **temporal video analysis** to detect manipulated media generated by modern AI techniques.

For image-level detection, forensic cues such as pixel-level inconsistencies and feature-based representations are analyzed.  
For video-level detection, deep learning models are used to extract spatial features and temporal patterns to identify deepfake manipulations across video sequences.

This framework was developed as an **academic research project** to explore the effectiveness of combining multiple forensic domains for robust media authenticity verification.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
To run or understand this framework, the following are recommended:

- Python 3.x  
- PyTorch  
- OpenCV  
- NumPy  
- Torchvision  
- A CUDA-enabled GPU (optional but recommended for training)

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash![Uploading Kamisato Ayaka Unofficial Art by @Bibimbub15.jpg…]()

   [git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository-name.git](https://github.com/zanzers/UnifiedForensicAnalyze.git)


- after you clone it 
- Navigate to the project directory cd your-repository-name
- Then Install required requirements pip install -r requirements.txt
- Then in that folder, create a folder named Updoad, thats where you'll upload the image or video
- Then create a python file name run.py(any name will do) then add this to that python file:
```
import subprocess
import os


def run_command(command):
    try:
        exe_path = os.path.join(
            os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(_file_)),
            "_mmmn",
            "UnifiedForensicAnalyze.exe"
        )

        subprocess.run([exe_path, command], check=True)

    except Exception as e:
        print(f"An error occurred: {e}")




if _name_ == "_main_":
    input_path = os.path.join(
        os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(_file_)),
        "uploads"
    )
    run_command(input_path)
```
Once executed, the framework will automatically process the uploaded image or video on the upload folder you put.


## Usage
This framework can be used to
- Train and evaluate models for AI-tampered image and deepfakes detection
- Detect deepfake videos and AI-tampered image 
- Analyze suspicious segments within video sequences
- Support academic research in digital forensics and media integrity
