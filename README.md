# Multi-Domain Forensic Detection of AI-Tampered Images and Deepfake Videos

## Description
This project presents a **multi-domain forensic detection framework** designed to identify **AI-tampered images and deepfake videos**.  
The framework integrates **spatial image forensics** and **temporal video analysis** to detect manipulated media generated by modern AI techniques.

For image-level detection, forensic cues such as pixel-level inconsistencies and feature-based representations are analyzed.  
For video-level detection, deep learning models are used to extract spatial features and temporal patterns to identify deepfake manipulations across video sequences.

This framework was developed as an **academic research project** to explore the effectiveness of combining multiple forensic domains for robust media authenticity verification.
